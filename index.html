<h2>WEB</h2>
    <p>Since its founding in 1994 by Web Inventor Tim Berners-Lee, the World Wide Web Consortium has developed the foundational technical standards upon which the Web has flourished. The Web and its place in society have changed dramatically, and the Web Consortium has been at the core of its technical interoperability. Today we need a more dramatic transformation to address the opportunities and threats the Web now faces and to continue to shape its future constructively.</p>

    <p>W3C is currently headquartered in Massachusetts, with staff members distributed around the world. Four institutions partner to “host” W3C: MIT (USA), ERCIM (France), Keio University (Japan), and Beihang University (China). We are planning the transition to a USA-based incorporated legal entity, a 501(c)(3) non-profit, as of January 1, 2022, which will continue to work with the distributed staff while consolidating financial and administrative functions. The Web Consortium is accepting proposals for Professional Employer Organization (PEO) Services; please consult our RFP.</p>
